## Adam Savage's SXSW 2014 Keynote: Art and Science
> Adam Savage talks about the importance of the relationship between art and science for his keynote at this year's SXSW Interactive Conference. What can scientists learn from artists (and vice versa)? How can technologists be better storytellers? Adam discusses these topics and more and then sits down for a Q&A.

## Gears of war: When mechanical analog computers ruled the waves

>"Just how can a box of gears, cams, racks, and pins handle ballistics calculations based on differential equations with dozens of variables in real time? How does it manage to put a hunk of metal weighing as much as a Volkswagen Beetle on top of a target over the horizon in the first place? And how did this metal and grease out-calculate digital systems for so long? Let's start with a little bit of a history on battleship ballistics—complete with vintage Navy training films to show precisely how mechanical analog computing works."

O artigo tem uns vídeos explicativos que valem muito a pena ver na página original. Dá vontade de pegar em LEGOs e aprender a construir uma calculadora.
