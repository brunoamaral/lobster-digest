## Gears of war: When mechanical analog computers ruled the waves

>"Just how can a box of gears, cams, racks, and pins handle ballistics calculations based on differential equations with dozens of variables in real time? How does it manage to put a hunk of metal weighing as much as a Volkswagen Beetle on top of a target over the horizon in the first place? And how did this metal and grease out-calculate digital systems for so long? Let's start with a little bit of a history on battleship ballistics—complete with vintage Navy training films to show precisely how mechanical analog computing works."

O artigo tem uns vídeos explicativos que valem muito a pena ver na página original. Dá vontade de pegar em LEGOs e aprender a construir uma calculadora.
